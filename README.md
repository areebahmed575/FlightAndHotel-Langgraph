# PakiGen Travel - Flight, Hotel & Email Agent

A smart travel agent built with LangGraph and FastAPI that specializes in domestic travel within Pakistan. The system uses AI agents to search for flights and hotels, then sends personalized travel itineraries via email.

## Features

- üõ´ **Flight Search**: Find domestic flights within Pakistan using Google Flights
- üè® **Hotel Search**: Discover hotels with customizable filters (rating, class, amenities)
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Agent**: LangGraph-based agent that intelligently uses tools to plan trips
- üìß **Email Integration**: Sends beautifully formatted HTML emails with travel options
- üîÑ **Stateful Conversations**: Maintains conversation context using checkpointers


## Architecture

The application uses LangGraph to create an agent workflow:

1. **Assistant Node**: Processes user requests and decides which tools to use
2. **Tools Node**: Executes flight and hotel search operations
3. **Email Sender Node**: Formats and sends travel itineraries via email

The workflow includes an interrupt before email sending, allowing for review or modification.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- OpenAI API key
- SerpAPI API key (for Google Flights/Hotels search)
- SendGrid API key (for email functionality)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>
```


2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_serpapi_api_key
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
```

## Usage

### Running Locally
